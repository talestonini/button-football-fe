  * It's a table, and it has repeatable sections, depending on how many finals matches there are in a given
  * championship.  That in turn is determined by how many teams qualify from the groups stage, and this number comes
  * from field 'numQualif' in the Championship model.  Remember the table needs to be rendered top to bottom, and not by
  * indexing a cell.
  * 
  * The funneling effect of a cup-format championship is represented by curves drawn from matches that qualify winners
  * of the round-of-sixteen to quarter-finals then to semi-finals and so on.  The table cells' bounding boxes are used
  * to calculate the positions of such curves, and we need empty columns B, D and F to help accomplish the effect.

  /**
   * General algorithm:
   *
   * 1) Build the funneling tree deriving from the number of qualified teams and the qualified teams themselves (com-
   * bination of the 2 signals).  Build starts from the grand final match, and progresses to the first stage after
   * the groups stage (eg round of sixteen or quarter-finals).  Nodes contain:
   * a) match seeding, eg seed 1 vs 8, 2 vs 7, etc (calculated)
   * b) table cell where to render the node, eg A1, C2 (calculated)
   * c) cells where 'to' render linking curve, eg the grand final cell links to the semifinals cells (calculated)
   * d) teams A and B (when hitting the leaf, fetch the qualified team by the seed number of the node)
   *
   * 2) While building the table (main Element above), traverse the tree (map) for each cell to:
   * a) render cell links
   * b) render teams A and B (here we fetch the match by team names to get scores, etc)
   *
   * NOTES:
   * 1) As we traverse the tree, we must save the 'static' cell links into a list, so that curves can be re-rendered
   * when the window is scrolled or resized.
   * 2) The beauty of the algorithm lies in the fact that we can calculate everything at tree build time and have it
   * ready to be traversed (multiple times) when rendering the table.  It's not easy to avoid traversing the tree
   * many times, because the algorithm is essentially crossing a table (HTML Element) with the data plotted on it
   * from a tree.  We could render the table in one passage and then traverse the tree once, indexing the table
   * cells to "pinpoint" where to render elements from the tree, but that would involve naming cells with indexes
   * and doing "dom.document.getElementById", which is not native Laminar (so I'll limit that technique only to
   * rendering BÃ©zier curves for now).  Plus, I'm betting traversing a small tree many times will be cheap.
